# PSOgooglemaps
Research and application of Particle Swarm Optimization to solve Travelling Salesman Problem with integration of GoogleMaps APIs to more real geographical issues

I believe it is 70% conclude.
I wrote a script in python to solve TSP problems using PSO (particle swarm optimization).
I have a page in php wich call this script and using some js librarys and webservices from googlemaps.
The objective is that you can select some points from map and the script calculates the best route for this points
And return for you in a static map with the route painted.

I agree this is not probably the best estructure, but for the research purposes this serve.

The library is 90% finished. But i need to start the layout.
